**WARNING: Third party clients are discouraged and against the Discord TOS.**

Discord Bot Client is a custom [Discord](https://discord.com/app) client that aims to
support bot accounts and be aimed at power-users.


The application only uses the official Discord API and doesn't send data to
third parties. However, this application is not an official product by
Discord Inc.

## Installation

### Using prebuilt binaries

If you don't want to build the application yourself or use some kind of
package management system, you can get the latest binaries for the three
major systems in the release overview:

https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/DiscordBotClient/releases/latest

### Building from source

In order to execute the following commands, you need to install **NodeJS v16 or**
higher. You can find nodejs packages at https://nodejs.org/en.
On top of that, you need to have **git** installed. It can be fund at
https://git-scm.com/downloads.

**UPDATES HAVE TO BE INSTALLED MANUALLY**

Open a command line and execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/DiscordBotClient.git
cd DiscordBotClient
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create an executable called `DiscordBotClient` or `DiscordBotClient.exe` in the `dist` folder depending on whether you are using Windows or not.

### Login

Logging in works via the UI on first startup of the application.

## Credits

Big thanks to [ChrisEric](https://github.com/DrxcoTheBulider) for helping me create a local proxy server! (code)

This project was mainly inspired by [SamuelScheit](https://github.com/SamuelScheit)
[Discord Bot Client](https://github.com/DrxcoTheBulider), which he sadly didn't
develop any further.
